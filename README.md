# fortuneteller

My version of the fortune teller project worked on by the DeltaV Code-201
students.

This version does not match the application planned by the students. However, it
does illustrate some interesting concepts.

- The JavaScript code is divided into a few classes, each defined in its own
  JavaScript file. This promotes modularity and Object-Oriented Programming
  (OOP).
- There is a utility HTML and JavaScript combination that illustrates how a
  coder can use those simple tools to produce output for their own use. In this
  case, it generates a more complex and tedious JSON object as text. That object
  is then used in the Fortune Teller program.
- The docs folder contains a couple of informative documents. The document
  _design.md_ includes a discussion of how I derived the class structure for the
  program. The _todo.md_ file describes some improvements that could be made and
  suggests some of the techniques that could be used to implement them.

Because the program was written quickly, there may be some issues to be found by
those looking for them.
