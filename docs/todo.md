# TODO

There are several things that could be done to improve the Fortune Teller
application. At this time, there is no imperative or pressure to perform any of
these tasks.

## Appearance

Though the application is "usable" it does not look nice. Actually, it looks
like it was built in 2005. An applicable makeover by someone with graphics
skills would be in order.

Along those lines, the CSS requires media queries to allow the tokens to be
displayed vertically when the screen gets too narrow.

## Tokens

The current set of tokens are randomly generated and the text is gibberish. It
would be nice to convert to an existing system or to provide some intelligible
text to this system. Because of the component-based structure of the
application, any token set can be used as long as the class members contain
useable data.

## User instructions

Currently, there are no instructions for the user. It would be nice to add that
to the page. In a perfect world, each peice would have tooltips. Also, there
should be a button the user can push to get a popup dialog with more
information.

## Examples

The utility example bundled with this project could use a lot more description.
It is not currently set up for use in a learning environment, i.e. it is not
written as curriculum.

Along that line, the code behind the Fortune Teller itself could be annotated
better for educational purposes. There are comments describing the classes and
functions, but there could always be a better description of why the structure
is as it is.
